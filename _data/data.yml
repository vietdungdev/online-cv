        I aspire to create higher-quality games that push boundaries and embrace creativity,
        which is why I’ve chosen the path of an indie game developer, keeping production costs lean.
        
          - I completed two indie games, Dungeon VS Gunner and Hill Racing Boss using Unity, which helped me learn a lot of new things.
          
          - With Dungeon VS Gunner, I gained experience coding the bullet hell system,
          the AI ​​system using Behavior Tree design, the weapon system including bullet guns with customizable trajectories,
          laser guns, melee weapons, and weapons using a particle system (when zombies spray poison), etc..
          
          - With Hill Racing Boss as a physics-based racing game, I've created motorcycles and riders with fun physics simulations.
          I'm also planning to add a multiplayer feature in the future.
          Some interesting features I've implemented are:
              + When a rider falls, they'll be thrown out like a ragdoll according to physics.
              + Players can collect item boxes or spin the bike around a lot to get in-game items,
              some of which help increase speed, provide protection, or create obstacles for those behind them.
              + Additionally, the game features races against powerful bosses, who are skilled at creating obstacles for other vehicles.
          
          - I am also developing a game entirely using Unity's DOTS technology and have a solid understanding of this technology.
